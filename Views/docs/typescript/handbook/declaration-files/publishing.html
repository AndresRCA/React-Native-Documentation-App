<h1 class="post-title">Publishing</h1>     <p>Now that you have authored a declaration file following the steps of this guide, it is time to publish it to npm. There are two main ways you can publish your declaration files to npm:</p> <ol> <li>bundling with your npm package, or</li> <li>publishing to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~types">@types organization</a> on npm.</li> </ol> <p>If your package is written in TypeScript then the first approach is favored. Use the <code>--declaration</code> flag to generate declaration files. This way, your declarations and JavaScript always be in sync.</p> <p>If your package is not written in TypeScript then the second is the preferred approach.</p> <h2 id="including-declarations-in-your-npm-package">Including declarations in your npm package</h2> <p>If your package has a main <code>.js</code> file, you will need to indicate the main declaration file in your <code>package.json</code> file as well. Set the <code>types</code> property to point to your bundled declaration file. For example:</p> <pre data-language="javascripton">{
  "name": "awesome",
  "author": "Vandelay Industries",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "./lib/main.js",
  "types": "./lib/main.d.ts"
}
</pre> <p>Note that the <code>"typings"</code> field is synonymous with <code>"types"</code>, and could be used as well.</p> <p>Also note that if your main declaration file is named <code>index.d.ts</code> and lives at the root of the package (next to <code>index.js</code>) you do not need to mark the <code>"types"</code> property, though it is advisable to do so.</p> <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2> <p>All dependencies are managed by npm. Make sure all the declaration packages you depend on are marked appropriately in the <code>"dependencies"</code> section in your <code>package.json</code>. For example, imagine we authored a package that used Browserify and TypeScript.</p> <pre data-language="javascripton">{
  "name": "browserify-typescript-extension",
  "author": "Vandelay Industries",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "./lib/main.js",
  "types": "./lib/main.d.ts",
  "dependencies": {
    "browserify": "latest",
    "@types/browserify": "latest",
    "typescript": "next"
  }
}
</pre> <p>Here, our package depends on the <code>browserify</code> and <code>typescript</code> packages. <code>browserify</code> does not bundle its declaration files with its npm packages, so we needed to depend on <code>@types/browserify</code> for its declarations. <code>typescript</code>, on the other hand, packages its declaration files, so there was no need for any additional dependencies.</p> <p>Our package exposes declarations from each of those, so any user of our <code>browserify-typescript-extension</code> package needs to have these dependencies as well. For that reason, we used <code>"dependencies"</code> and not <code>"devDependencies"</code>, because otherwise our consumers would have needed to manually install those packages. If we had just written a command line application and not expected our package to be used as a library, we might have used <code>devDependencies</code>.</p> <h2 id="red-flags">Red flags</h2> <h3 id="-reference-path-"><code>/// &lt;reference path="..." /&gt;</code></h3> <p><em>Don’t</em> use <code>/// &lt;reference path="..." /&gt;</code> in your declaration files.</p> <pre data-language="typescript">/// &lt;reference path="../typescript/lib/typescriptServices.d.ts" /&gt;
....
</pre> <p><em>Do</em> use <code>/// &lt;reference types="..." /&gt;</code> instead.</p> <pre data-language="typescript">/// &lt;reference types="typescript" /&gt;
....

<em>Don’t</em> combine it with yours, keep each in their own file.</li> <li>
<em>Don’t</em> copy the declarations in your package either.</li> <li>
<em>Do</em> depend on the npm type declaration package if it doesn’t package its declaration files.</li> </ul> <h2 id="publish-to-types">Publish to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~types">@types</a>
