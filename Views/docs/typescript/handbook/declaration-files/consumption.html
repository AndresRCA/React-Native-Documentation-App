<h1 class="post-title">Consumption</h1>     <p>In TypeScript 2.0, it has become significantly easier to consume declaration files, in acquiring, using, and finding them. This page details exactly how to do all three.</p> <h2 id="downloading">Downloading</h2> <p>Getting type declarations in TypeScript 2.0 and above requires no tools apart from npm.</p> <p>As an example, getting the declarations for a library like lodash takes nothing more than the following command</p> <pre data-language="cmd">npm install --save @types/lodash
</pre> <p>It is worth noting that if the npm package already includes its declaration file as described in <a href="publishing">Publishing</a>, downloading the corresponding <code>@types</code> package is not needed.</p> <h2 id="consuming">Consuming</h2> <p>From there you’ll be able to use lodash in your TypeScript code with no fuss. This works for both modules and global code.</p> <p>For example, once you’ve <code>npm install</code>-ed your type declarations, you can use imports and write</p> <pre data-language="typescript">import * as _ from "lodash";
_.padStart("Hello TypeScript!", 20, " ");
</pre> <p>or if you’re not using modules, you can just use the global variable <code>_</code>.</p> <pre data-language="typescript">_.padStart("Hello TypeScript!", 20, " ");
</pre> <h2 id="searching">Searching</h2> <p>For the most part, type declaration packages should always have the same name as the package name on <code>npm</code>, but prefixed with <code>@types/</code>, but if you need, you can check out <a href="https://aka.ms/types">https://aka.ms/types</a> to find the package for your favorite library.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: if the declaration file you are searching for is not present, you can always contribute one back and help out the next developer looking for it. Please see the DefinitelyTyped <a href="http://definitelytyped.org/guides/contributing.html">contribution guidelines page</a> for details.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
